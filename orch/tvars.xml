  <title>Vectors and Arrays</title>
  <para>
    Vectors and arrays of i-rate, k-rate or a-rate values can be used
    in many cases.  They are created by the <link
    linkend="init"><citetitle>init</citetitle></link> opcode and
    others, and can be used in most arithmetic situations as well as
    special array opcodes.

    For a short time Csound had a more limited scheme of one dimensional
    vectors at k-rate, but these are subsummed in the arrays, and
    t-variables are deprecated.
    <!-- Csound allows the declaration and deployment of one-dimensional -->
    <!-- vectors or tables.  They are local to an instrument, and need to -->
    <!-- be declared for size (with the <link -->
    <!-- linkend="init"><citetitle>init</citetitle></link> opcode. -->
    <!-- Individual elements are read as part of any expression with square -->
    <!-- brackets to give an index at k-rate.  Individual elements can be -->
    <!-- assigned, and there are a number of opcodes to query and modify tables. -->
