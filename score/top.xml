  <title>The Standard Numeric Score</title>
  <para>
    The score section contains events that instatiate instruments from the orchestra. There are various score statements that enable complex score building within the csound language.

  <para>
    Currently, the maximum length of the score depends on the
    platform's architecture; on a 32bit system tis is
    2<superscript>31</superscript>-1 control periods; so for example,
    with kr=1500, you can run a score for a maximum of about 16.5 days
    before problems occur due to overflowing signed 32-bit integer
    variables.  On a 64bit machine the same condition would be
    just about 9 billion years. The input token 'z' is read as a
    number with the value of approximately 25367 years.

    Note also that when using single precision floats (i.e. the 'f'
    installers rather than the 'd' ones), the accuracy of timing
    becomes worse after performing for a long time.
