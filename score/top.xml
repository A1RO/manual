  <title>The Standard Numeric Score</title>
  <para>
    The score section contains events that instatiate instruments from the orchestra. There are various score statements that enable complex score building within the csound language.

  <para>
    Currently, the maximum length of the score is 2<superscript>31</superscript>-1 control periods. For example, with kr=1500, you can run a score for a maximum of about 16.5 days before problems occur due to overflowing signed 32-bit integer variables.

    Note also that when using single precision floats (i.e. the 'f' installers rather than the 'd' ones), the accuracy of timing becomes worse after performing for a long time.
