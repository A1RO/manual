      It is sometimes convenient to have the score in more than one file. This use is supported by the <emphasis>&num;include</emphasis> facility which is part of the macro system.  A line containing the text

      <indexterm id="IndexIncludeScore"><primary>&num;include</primary><secondary>score</secondary></indexterm>
      <indexterm id="IndexMultiFileScore"><primary>multiple file scores</primary></indexterm>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<emphasis>&num;include</emphasis> &quot;filename&quot;</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      where the character <emphasis>&quot;</emphasis> can be replaced by any suitable character.  For most uses the double quote symbol will probably be the most convenient. The file name can include a full path.
    </para>

    <para>
      This takes input from the named file until it ends, when input reverts to the previous input.  There is currently a limit of 20 on the depth of included files and macros.
    </para>

    <para>
      A suggested use of <emphasis>&num;include</emphasis> would be to define a set of macros which are part of the composer's style.  It could also be used to provide repeated sections.

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<emphasis role="stamnt">s</emphasis>
#include :section1:
<emphasis role="comment">;; Repeat that</emphasis>
<emphasis role="stamnt">s</emphasis>
#include :section1:</programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
      Alternative methods of doing repeats, use the <link linkend="r"><citetitle>r statement</citetitle></link>, <link linkend="m"><citetitle>m statement</citetitle></link>, and <link linkend="n"><citetitle>n statement</citetitle></link>.
    </para>
  </simplesect>

  <simplesect>
    <para>
      The form <emphasis>&num;includestr</emphasis> is te same as &num;include
      except the deliminatotr must be a double uote and the file name
      may contain macro calls.
